# odin-recipes
This project takes place around halfway through the Odin Project, and is designed to familiarize students with using Git and Github. The coursework so far has been extremely helpful, and I've learned everything from cloning a repo on Github to writing short but informational commit messages.

This README is supposed to be filled with text, and I'm pretty good at stream of consciousness typing. Will this project feature ACTUAL recipes? I don't know yet. I've only been instructed to prepare this README. I hope it does, though. I like recipes.
