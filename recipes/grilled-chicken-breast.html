    <p><em>Grilled chicken breast</em> is an extremely simple yet extremely important part of any diet that needs to be big on protein and small on calories. Thankfully, grilling a quality chicken breast is only as hard as we make it!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>2 boneless chicken breasts, around 8 ounces (227 grams) each</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30 grams) of olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons (30 grams) of your favorite soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons (9 grams) of salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons (9 grams) of pepper</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Cut shallow slits into the chicken breasts. This will help our marinade penetrate the meat.</li>
    <li>Whisk together your olive oil, soy sauce, salt and pepper in a small mixing bowl. Use a pastry brush to evenly spread mixture between both chicken breasts.</li>
    <li>Preheat your grill to 450 degrees fahrenheit (232 celsius). If using a pan, bring to medium-high heat. Grease grill or pan with preferred oil or spray.</li>
    <li>Grill both chicken breasts until thoroughly cooked, flipping halfway through. Cooking time can and will vary pending on cooktops and grills. Always make sure your chicken is cooked to 165 fahrenheit (74 celsius) to avoid foodborne illness.</li>
    <li>Let the chicken breasts rest under aluminum foil for 5 minutes before serving alongside your favorite vegetables.</li></ol>
