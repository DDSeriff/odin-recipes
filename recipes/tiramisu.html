    <p>Is there a name for a dessert that tempts you in ways that you never thought possible? A dessert that can lead the strongest of diets astray, and bend the strongest of wills to its sweet desires? There is. And its name is <em>tiramisu</em>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of heavy cream</li>
    <li>8 ounces (227 grams) of mascarpone cheese, brought to room temperature</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (113 grams) of granulated white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of cold espresso</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) of coffee flavored liqueur</li>
    <li>1 package of lady fingers</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder for dusting the top of your tiramisu</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Add your whipping cream to a large mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with an electric mixer. A stand mixer is ideal. Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue beating until stiff peaks are formed in the cream. Add the mascarpone cheese and continue to mix until combined.</li>
    <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Quickly dip the lady fingers in the mixture, careful not so soak them. Lay your dipped lady fingers in an 8x8 (or similar) pan.</li>
    <li>Smooth half of the mixture from <strong>step one</strong> over the top of your dipped fingers. Add another layer of dipped fingers, and again add more of the mixture, smoothing it over the top.</li>
    <li>Dust cocoa powder over the top and refrigerate for 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li></ol>
