    <p><em>Mulled wine</em> is normally only something that I associate with the winter (or, really just Christmas, if I'm being honest) but its an easy drink to make and one that I associate with dead trees and roaring fireplaces. And also it's an easy drink for me to write out the recipe for.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 bottle (750 ml) of your favorite wine</li>
    <li>1/4th (~60 ml) cup of brandy or orange liqueur</li>
    <li>8 whole cloves</li>
    <li>2 star anise</li>
    <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
    <li>2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 grams) of sugar, honey, or maple syrup. Sweetner substitutes work, too.</li>
    <li><em>Optional</em>: Slices of oranges or lemons</li>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Combine all of your ingredients in a large saucepan, and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Cook the combination over medium-high heat until it barely reaches a simmer, you <strong>do not</strong> want it to bubble. Reduce heat to low and cover, letting it simmer for at least 15 minutes or up to 3 hours.</li>
    <li>Strain your mixture through a fine mesh strainer to remove orange slices, cloves, cinnamon sticks and anise. Sample your mulled wine and add more sweetner, if desired.</li>
    <li>Serve in your favoite mugs and enjoy the winter just outside of your window.</li></ol>
