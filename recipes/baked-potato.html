    <h1>Baked Potato</h1>

    <p>Who doesn't like a good <em>baked potato?</em> I'm serious. Show me the person that says that they don't like a baked potato, and I'll show you a liar. I mean, barring any food allergies, of course. Regardless, I, myself, love baked potatoes. They're easy to make, they're filling, and you can put just about anything you want on them! Except for like, ice cream. Or chocolate.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 large russet potato</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil (enough to coat the potato)</li>
    <li>~2 teaspoons of kosher salt</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit (232 celsius) and line a baking sheet with your favorite parchment paper. Cooking spray works in lieu of parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Use a fork to poke holes in your potato. This keeps them from exploding in your oven. Coat with olive oil and sprinkle liberally with salt.</li>
    <li>Bake your potato for 45 minutes to an hour. Check for doneness by fork-tenderness and crispy skin.</li>
    <li>Serve with favorite toppings, like butter, sour cream, chives and/or shredded cheese.</li></ol>
